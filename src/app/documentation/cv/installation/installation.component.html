                        <br>
                        The first thing you have to do is make sure you have angular installed on your computer, if not,
                        please read the angular official site and guide:
                        <a href="https://angular.io/guide/setup-local">https://angular.io/guide/setup-local</a>
                        <br><br>
                        Having angular already installed, open the command prompt ang go to the folder you want to
                        create your angular project and run the next command:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="codeheader" id="codeheader_commands">Command Prompt</div>
                        <div id="codebox">
                                <code>
                                        ng new <span class="replace">[App name]</span>
                                </code>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        After it finished, you’ll have your own angular project to work with.The next step is to create
                        the components I listed above, for that run each one of the commands I’ll list one by one:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="codeheader" id="codeheader_commands">Command Prompt</div>
                        <div id="codebox">
                                <code>
                                        cd <span class="replace">[Appname]</span>
                                        <br><br>
                                        ng g c home
                                        <br><br>
                                        ng g c play
                                        <br><br>
                                        ng g c about
                                        <br><br>
                                        ng g c background
                                        <br><br>
                                        ng g c contact
                                        <br><br>
                                        ng g c menu
                                        <br><br>
                                        ng g c loading
                                        <br><br>
                                        ng serve --open
                                </code>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        In case you did everything right, you should now be on your browser on the default angular
                        landing. Congrats! You have now the base to make an awesome angular app.
                        <br><br>
                        The next step is to upload your app to an AWS storage, where we are going to be able to see our
                        app online from our local files.In this version I’ll only be explaining how to upload the local
                        files, be tune for the next version of this guide where I’ll be explaining how to use a git
                        repository to publish your app.
                        <br><br>
                        Now, for the deployment we need to create a new account on <a
                                href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/">https://aws.amazon.com/console/</a>. AWS offers a
                        lot of free services; you can check it out. Inour case, we need S3.
                        <br><br>
                        Once you get past the registration, on the services’ navigation menu, search for the S3 title,
                        under it, you’ll find “Storage option”.
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="center"><img src="../../../../assets/doc/cv/install/i1.png"></div>
                        <br><br>
                        The first thing we need to do is to create a bucket name but be careful, this name needs to be
                        unique and chosen wisely as it will appear on your website URL.
                        <br><br>
                        The region selection is pretty simple, just select the closest region to you, so the server will
                        be able to load the website faster.
                        <br><br>
                        Click on “Create Bucket” at the bottom and that's it, you now have your S3 bucket. You should
                        see something like this on your S3 dashboard:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="center"><img src="../../../../assets/doc/cv/install/i2.png"></div>
                        <br><br>
                        If everything is correct, try going to your bucket just to check everything is alright, the URL
                        will be:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="center"><b><span class="replace">(bucket name)</span>.s3-website.<span
                                                class="replace">(time zone name)</span>.amazonaws.com</b></div>
                        <br>
                        You can find your time zone name on the bucket list, on the region description. In my case, it
                        should be:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="center"><b><span class="replace">documentation-cv</span>.s3-website.<span
                                                class="replace">us-west-1</span>.amazonaws.com</b></div>
                        <br>
                        Assuming that everything is correct, you should be now seen a website like this:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="center"><img src="../../../../assets/doc/cv/install/i3.png"></div>
                        <br><br>
                        Congrats! You have created your bucket correctly.      
                        <br><br>
                        This error is due to the fact that we do not have access to the bucket.
                        <br><br>
                        Now, to configure our bucket to be accessible, follow the next guide:
                        <br><br>
                        Open your bucket by clicking on its name, go to the “Properties”tab, go to the button and click
                        on the “Edit” button in the “Static Web Hosting” section.
                        <br><br>
                        Inside it, enable the static webhosting and leave everything else like this:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="center"><img src="../../../../assets/doc/cv/install/i4.png"></div>
                        <br><br>
                        Go to the “Permissions” tab and press the “Edit” button in the “Block public access” section.
                        Uncheck the “Block all public access” and just leave the first and second box checked:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="center"><img src="../../../../assets/doc/cv/install/i5.png"></div>
                        <br><br>
                        Save changes and go to the “Bucket Policy” section and click on “Edit”. Here we need to grant
                        anonymous users access to our data. For that, we need to paste the next policy, just change your
                        bucket name where is required:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="codeheader" id="codeheader_aws">Bucket Policy</div>
                        <div id="codebox">
                                <pre><code data-language="html">
                    {{ '{' }}
                        "Version": "2012-10-17",
                        "Statement": 
                            [
                                {{ '{' }}
                                    "Sid": "AddPermission",
                                    "Effect": "Allow",
                                    "Principal": "*",
                                    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
                                    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<b class="replace">(bucket name)</b>/*"
                                }
                            ]
                    }
                </code></pre>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        That’s it, everything is ready for the deployment. The last step is to upload our angular app;
                        make sure to build the app and upload the output as explained here:
                        <br><br>
                        Open your command prompt and go to the folder of your project.There, run this command:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="codeheader" id="codeheader_commands">Command Prompt</div>
                        <div id="codebox">
                                <code>
                        ng build
                                </code>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        You’ll find a new folder on your project called “dist”. This is the output of the angular app
                        building. In case you don’t know where the dist folder is, go to the “angular.json”:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="center"><img src="../../../../assets/doc/cv/install/i6.png"></div>
                        <br><br>
                        Now, you can just upload manually the folder to your bucket and that’s it, the problem is that
                        you’ll need to upload the foldereverything you make changes on your app, to fix that, I’ll
                        explain how to automatically upload your app.
                        <br><br>
                        Go to <a
                                href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users">https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users</a>.
                        Here we are going to create an user to give it access to the bucket.
                        <br><br>
                        Press on “Add User”. Give a name to the user a select the “Programmatic access” in “Access type”
                        and click “Next”.
                        <br><br>
                        On permission, we are going to give our user the default administrator access. Select “Attach
                        existing policies directly” then, check the “AdministratorAccess-Amplify” box.
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="center"><img src="../../../../assets/doc/cv/install/i7.png"></div>
                        <br><br>
                        Click “Next” until the user is created, and you get to this screen:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="center"><img src="../../../../assets/doc/cv/install/i8.png"></div>
                        <br><br>
                        I suggest downloading the .csv file, we are going to need the access key and the secret access
                        key.
                        <br><br>
                        We need to install AWS CLI to be able to use AWS command on our command prompt. In case you have
                        a Mac, you only need to run this command:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="codeheader" id="codeheader_commands">Command Prompt</div>
                        <div id="codebox">
                                <code>
                                        brew install awscli
                                </code>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        In case you have Windows, please follow the AWS installation guide (just install the .msi file):
                        <a
                                href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-windows.html</a>
                        <br><br>To
                        check if you successfully installed AWS CLI, in the terminal run:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="codeheader" id="codeheader_commands">Command Prompt</div>
                        <div id="codebox">
                                <code>
                                        aws --version
                                </code>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        When you get sure you have AWS CLI, run:
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="codeheader" id="codeheader_commands">Command Prompt</div>
                        <div id="codebox">
                                <code>
                                        aws configure
                                </code>
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        Enter your AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name (time zone name) and
                        Default output format (“ENTER” will do).
                        <br><br>
                        On your project, go to the “package.json” and add this line:"aws-deploy" :
                        <br><br>
                        <div class="codeheader" id="codeheader_js">package.json</div>
                        <div id="codebox">
                                <code>
