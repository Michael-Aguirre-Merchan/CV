                <p> I am passionate about video games and more about strategy. That's why I decided to use my knowledge
                    in software development to create a game (obviously, this is a work in progress, there are always
                    things that can be improved and perfected).<br><br>
                    Why chess? I think this game has qualities that help you forget the stress of hectic everyday life
                    and be an admirable activity that combines mathematical precision with intuition.
                    If you've played chess before, you know that the most challenging thing is maintaining constant
                    concentration. On the contrary, it is your first time; I could summarize that chess is a game for
                    two players on a board with 32 pieces (16 for each player) of six types. Each piece moves
                    differently. The game's object is to checkmate, that is, to threaten the opponent's king with
                    capture until it is unavoidable.<br><br>
                    I hope I can capture the attention of everyone who visits this website and helps a little to create
                    a distraction from the daily routine.<br><br>
